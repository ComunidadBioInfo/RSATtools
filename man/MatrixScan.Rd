\usage{
MatrixScan(sequence, matrix, sequence.format = "fasta",
  matrix.format = "tab", quick = FALSE, n.treatment = NULL,
  concensus.name = NULL, pseudo = 1, equi.pseudo = FALSE,
  top.matrices = NULL, background.model = NULL, background = NULL,
  background.input = NULL, background.window = NULL, markov = NULL,
  background.pseudo = NULL, return.fields = NULL,
  sort.distrib = FALSE, lth = NULL, uth = NULL, str = NULL,
  origin = NULL, decimals = NULL, crer.ids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence}{Sequence(s) to scan - all the formats supported in RSAT can be used as input (default: \code{fasta})}

\item{matrix}{Matrix/ces to scan with. The matrix format is specified with the option \code{matrix.format} (see below) Default format: \code{tab}.}

\item{sequence.format}{Supported fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{fasta} (default)
\item \code{IG} (Intelligenetics)
\item \code{WC} (wconsensus)
\item \code{raw}
}}

\item{matrix.format}{Supported fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{tab}
\item \code{cb}
\item \code{consensus}
\item \code{gibbs}
\item \code{meme}
\item \code{assembly}
}}

\item{quick}{Delegates scanning to the C program matrix-scan-quick (developed by Matthieu Defrance). Evaluate if the quick mode is compatible with the selected output parameters, otherwise, run in the slower mode. Incompatible with - CRER scanning - window background model.}

\item{n.treatment}{Treatment of N characters. These characters are often used in DNA sequences to represent undefined or masked nucleotides.
\itemize{
\item \code{skip}.  N-containing regions are skipped.
\item \code{score}. N-containing regions are scored. The probability of an N is 1 for both the background model and the matrix. The N residues will thus contribute neither positively nor negatively to the weight score of the N-containing fragment. This option can be useful to detect sites which are at the border of N-containing regions, or in cases there are isolated N in the sequences.
}}

\item{pseudo}{Pseudo-count for the matrix (default: 1). The pseudo-count reflects the possibility that residues that were not (yet) observed in the model might however be valid for future observations. The pseudo-count is used to compute the corrected residue frequencies.}

\item{equi.pseudo}{If this option is called,  the pseudo-weight is distributed in an equiprobable way between residues. By default,  the pseudo-weight is distributed proportionally to residue priors,  except for the -window option where equipseudo is default.}

\item{top.matrices}{Only scan with the top # matrices per matrix file. This option is valid for some file formats containing multiple matrices where top matrices are generally more informative.}

\item{background.model}{Background model is a tab-delimited specification of oligonucleotide frequencies.}

\item{background}{To use a precalculated background model from RSAT. Works with organism and markov options. Type of sequences used as background model for estimating expected oligonucleotide frequencies.
Supported:
\itemize{
\item \code{upstream}
\item \code{upstream-noorf}
\item \code{upstream-noorf-rm}
\item \code{intergenic}
}}

\item{background.input}{Calculate background model from the input sequence set. This option requires to specify the order of the background model with the option markov.}

\item{background.window}{Size of the sliding window for the background model calculation. This option requires to specify the order of the background model with the option markov (suitable for short order model only markov 0 or 1)}

\item{markov}{Order of the markov chain for the background model. This option is incompatible with the option background.}

\item{background.pseudo}{Pseudo frequency for the background models. Value must be a real between 0 and 1.
If this option is not specified,  the pseudo-frequency value depends on the background calculation.
For \code{background.input} and \code{background_window},  the pseudo frequency is automatically calculated with the length (L) of the sequence following this formula:
square-root of L divided by L+squareroot of L.
For \code{background.model},  default value is 0.01.
If the training sequence length (L) is known,  the value can be set by \code{background.pseudo} option to square-root of L divided by L+squareroot of L.}

\item{return.fields}{List of fields to return.
Supported fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{sites}
\item \code{rank}
\item \code{limits}
\item \code{normw}
\item \code{bg_model}
\item \code{matrix}
\item \code{freq_matrix}
\item \code{weight_matrix}
\item \code{distrib}
}}

\item{sort.distrib}{Sort score distribution by decreasing value of significance,  if value TRUE. By default,  the score distributions are sorted by score (weight).}

\item{lth}{Lower threshold on some parameter. Format=list of 'parameter value'.
Supported fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{score}
\item \code{pval}
\item \code{eval}
\item \code{sig}
\item \code{normw}
\item \code{proba_M}
\item \code{proba_B}
\item \code{rank}
\item \code{crer_sites}
\item \code{crer_size}
\item \code{occ}
\item \code{occ_sum}
\item \code{inv_cum}
\item \code{exp_occ}
\item \code{occ_pval}
\item \code{occ_eval}
\item \code{occ_sig}
\item \code{occ_sig_rank}
}}

\item{uth}{Upper threshold on some parameter. Format=list of 'param value'. Supported parameters: same as \code{lth}.}

\item{str}{Scan 1 or 2 strands for DNA sequences.}

\item{origin}{Define the origin for the calculation of positions.
\code{origin} -0 defines the end of each sequence as the origin.
The matching positions are then negative values, providing the distance between the match and the end of the sequence.}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimals displayed for the weight score.}

\item{consensus.name}{Use the motif (degenerate) consensus as matrix name.}

\item{organism}{To use a precalculated background model from RSAT, choose the organism corresponding to the background model. Works with background and markov options.}

\item{crer_ids}{Assign one separate feature ID per CRER. This option is convenient to distinguish separate CRERs.}
}
\value{
an R object with results retrieved from RSAT
}
\description{
Scan sequences with one or several position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) to identify instances of the corresponding motifs (putative sites). This function supports a variety of background models (Bernoulli, Markov chains of any order).
